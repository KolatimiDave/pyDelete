*  Clone/download to your local pc.
*  Open the command-line interface on your system, command prompt for windows, terminal for linux.
*  Make sure you're in the directory where the main.py is, then run python main.py --file 'FILENAME TO BE DELETED' --folder 'ROOT DIRECTORY OF FOLDER WHERE FILES ARE'

## Project inspiration
Yeah, so i cloned a github repository, and this repository had 4 folders which had 3 sub-folders and in each of all these folders there was a .DS_Store file and i had to navigate 12 times to delete them.
So i thought to myself to create a command-line tool that would do this for me fast and easily anytime i want.
